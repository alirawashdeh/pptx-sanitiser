```
git clone https://github.com/alirawashdeh/pptx-sanitiser.git
cd pptx-sanitiser
dotnet restore
```

# Usage

Place pptx files into the ```pptx-sanitiser``` folder or any subfolder. There is an example file in the ```pptx-sanitiser/pptx``` folder.
Run the application using the following:

```
dotnet run
```

A message will be outputted for each file processed:

```
Updated file: /Users/person/git/pptx-sanitiser/pptx/example.pptx ðŸ‘Œ
```

## Warnings

- :warning: **Files are updated in situ** so make sure you copy the ```pptx``` files into the ```pptx-sanitiser folder``` rather than moving them

- :warning: Text is updated by replacing all alphanumeric characters with the character ```x```. This means that spaces are preserved, along with any other characters (#, @, etc.). If your content is extremely sensitive - or can be guessed from word lengths alone - this tool will not be suitable.

- :warning: Images are not sanitised during this process so make sure that you check each processed file for images (in the slides or master)

- :warning: Text within SmartArt is not updated during the process, so make sure you check for SmartArt in the processed files.
